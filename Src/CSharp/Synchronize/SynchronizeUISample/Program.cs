       * How to license Xceed components 
       * ================================       
       * To license your product, set the LicenseKey property to a valid trial or registered license key 
       * in the main entry point of the application to ensure components are licensed before any of the 
       * component methods are called.      
       * 
       * If the component is used in a DLL project (no entry point available), it is 
       * recommended that the LicenseKey property be set in a static constructor of a 
       * class that will be accessed systematically before any component is instantiated or, 
       * you can simply set the LicenseKey property immediately BEFORE you instantiate 
       * an instance of the component.
       * 
       * For instance, if you wanted to deploy this sample, the license key needs to be set in the Main() method.
       * If your trial period has expired, you must purchase a registered license key,
       * uncomment the next line of code, and insert your registerd license key.
       * For more information, consult the "How the 45-day trial works" and the 
       * "How to license the component once you purchase" topics in the documentation of this product.
